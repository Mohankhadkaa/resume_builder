Project Name: CV Builder

#Description:

This project is a web-based CV (curriculum vitae) builder application that allows users to input their personal information, educational background, work experience, skills, projects, and achievements to generate a professional CV. The application provides real-time validation of user inputs, image preview functionality, and the ability to dynamically add or remove sections as needed.

Features:

User-friendly web interface for inputting CV information.
Real-time validation of form inputs using regular expressions.
Image preview functionality for uploading a profile picture.
Dynamically add or remove sections such as achievements, experiences, education, projects, and skills.
Display the generated CV on the webpage in real-time.
Print the generated CV directly from the browser.
Technologies Used:

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
jQuery
jQuery Repeater Plugin


Challenges:

Real-time Validation: Implementing real-time validation for form inputs while ensuring a smooth user experience posed a challenge. It required handling various types of input data (text, email, phone number) and providing meaningful error messages.

Dynamic Section Addition/Removal: Implementing dynamic addition and removal of sections (such as achievements, experiences, etc.) required careful handling of DOM manipulation and ensuring data consistency.

Image Preview: Enabling users to preview an image before uploading it involved handling file input events and updating the image preview element dynamically.

Solutions:

Real-time Validation: Utilized regular expressions to validate form inputs for names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc. Error messages were displayed dynamically next to each input field to provide immediate feedback to users.

Dynamic Section Addition/Removal: Implemented the jQuery Repeater plugin to handle dynamic addition and removal of form sections. This plugin simplified the process of managing repeated form fields and ensured data consistency.

Image Preview: Used JavaScript's FileReader API to read the contents of the uploaded image file and display a preview in an image element. This allowed users to visualize the image before finalizing their selection.

Usage:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Fill in the required CV information in the provided form fields.
Optionally, upload a profile picture to preview it.
Add or remove sections as needed using the provided buttons.
Review the generated CV displayed on the webpage.
Print the CV directly from the browser for offline use.
